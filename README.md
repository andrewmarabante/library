# library
Now that I'm getting a kinda good at css and html, it's time to work on my javascript! In this project I'm going to be creating a library where users can add or remove books that have their own corresponding information. They will also be able to inquire information about books!! Let's get started!!! 

So I'm Done! In this project I learned how to create objects using an object constructer, How to create html elements using javascript,how to use "this" correctly and a bunch of other javascript stuff. I have used some of this earlier in the foundations course but it was all stuff I had to search up online and I didn't use it to this extent at all. So overall a great project to start the javascript course on. Something that really surprised me was HOW FAST I JUST CODED THAT CSS. I was thinking... eh this is a javascript project the css is not the point so i'll just do bare minimum. Turns out my bare minimum is pretty darn good considering I did it in about 15 minutes and it doesn't look bad at all! That's why we spent so much time working on css before hopping into javascript...
